    <h1>Content Policy</h1>
  </header>
  <main class="box">
    <h2>1. Our Approach</h2>
    <p>STAR DRIFTR is a platform for sharing dreams anonymously, fostering creativity and self-expression. We allow broad freedom in the content you post, including descriptions of violent dreams, provided it complies with this Content Policy and applicable laws.</p>

    <h2>2. Prohibited Content</h2>
    <p>While we encourage open expression, the following types of content are strictly prohibited:
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Child Sexual Abuse Material (CSAM)</strong>: Any content depicting or promoting child pornography or exploitation is illegal and will be reported to authorities.</li>
        <li><strong>Illegal Content</strong>: Content that violates local, national, or international laws, including but not limited to incitement to violence, terrorism, or trafficking.</li>
        <li><strong>Harassment and Hate Speech</strong>: Content that targets individuals or groups with abuse, threats, or discrimination based on race, ethnicity, religion, gender, sexual orientation, or other protected characteristics.</li>
        <li><strong>Non-Consensual Explicit Content</strong>: Text descriptions explicitly promoting or depicting non-consensual sexual acts. Note that explicit images cannot be posted, as all images are AI-generated and explicit content is blocked by our systems.</li>
        <li><strong>Spam or Malicious Content</strong>: Content designed to deceive, scam, or introduce malware or other harmful code.</li>
        <li><strong>Unauthorized Promotions</strong>: Content promoting external websites, products, services, or entities, including external links, unless through STAR DRIFTRâ€™s official advertising channels.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>3. Content Moderation</h2>
    <p>We use automated systems to prevent prohibited content from being posted. Additionally, we reserve the right to review, remove, or restrict any content that violates this policy or is otherwise deemed inappropriate, at our sole discretion. Violations may result in account suspension or termination.</p>

    <h2>4. Reporting Violations</h2>
    <p>If you encounter content that violates this policy, use the "Report" button on the post to notify us. Alternatively, you may contact us at [insert contact email]. We will investigate promptly and take appropriate action.</p>

    <h2>5. User Responsibility</h2>
    <p>You are responsible for ensuring your content complies with this policy and all applicable laws. By posting, you acknowledge that STAR DRIFTR owns the intellectual property rights to your content, as outlined in our <a href="terms.html">Terms and Conditions</a>.</p>

    <h2>6. Changes to Content Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Content Policy at any time. Changes will be posted on this page, and continued use of the Website constitutes acceptance.</p>
